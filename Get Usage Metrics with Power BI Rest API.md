# Introduction

Power BI provides an opportunity to monitor usage metrics of dashboards and reports to track how they're used in your organization. 
However, the native usage metrics datasets provide limited functionality, e.g. there's no way to get usage metrics across all workspaces in one page.
To make usage metrics reports more flexible it's better to extract this data using a Power BI Rest API solution which is not straightforward and involves a lot of moving parts to make it work properly.
In this guide I'll be showing how to create a stable usage metric solution and how to make it work.
The whole process will be broken into the following sections:

1. Overwiew and how it works
2. Giving permissions to a user and setting up a Service Principal
3. Giving permissions to the Service Principal on Power BI side
4. Setting up a token
5. Getting data from edpoints
6. Extracting the data
7. Final thoughts
8. Common problems

#  Overwiew and how it works

* First, create a custom application that will be requesting the data on our behalf - [Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/embed-service-principal?tabs=azure-portal).

* Then, give your Service Principal access to Microsoft Fabric portal and workspaces where you need to get the usage metrics from.

* Finally, use the token generated by your Service Principal to access the usage metrics data. 

* The hierarchy of in usage metrics data looks like: workspace -> usage metrics report -> table. To get the usage metrics data the workspace id, the report id and the table name is required.
 
* Use this [playground](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/apps/get-app#code-try-0) to see how endpoints work.
